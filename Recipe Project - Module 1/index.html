                        Break six eggs into a frying pan, add four ounces of butter, 
                        a large punch of salt and a trigle of pepper; 
                        fry quickly as for an ordinary omelette; 
                        meanwhile you will have minced ready the breast of a partridge or any remains of cold game, 
                        add just a shred of onion and a tiny bit of chopped parsley, 
                        make the mixture quite hot in a seperate saucepan, 
                        and when your omlette is ready spread it over the top; 
                        fold it quickly and serve. 
                        Remember it must be taken to the table piping hot or it will be leathery.
